SystemSpec — hardware system spec loaded from a per-system YAML file.

Subclasses ``dict`` so existing code that does ``spec["gpu"]["mem_bw"]`` or
``isinstance(spec, dict)`` keeps working. ``get_p2p_bandwidth`` and
``get_p2p_latency`` are the only added methods; the former replaces
``PerfDatabase._get_p2p_bandwidth``.

        The latency counterpart of :meth:`get_p2p_bandwidth`. Two tiers are
        enough here: ``p2p_latency`` covers a scale-up domain (node or rack),
        while crossing racks pays the scale-out fabric's round trip instead.

        behavior.

        Leaving one rack cannot be faster than staying inside it, so the
        cross-rack value is clamped at ``p2p_latency``. That guard is load-
        bearing rather than defensive: some shipped specs raise ``p2p_latency``
        by hand as a calibration knob (gb200/gb300 label theirs a "nonofficial
        correction") while ``inter_rack_latency`` keeps the textbook InfiniBand
        figure, which leaves the pair inverted. Nothing read
        ``inter_rack_latency`` before this method existed, so the inconsistency
