"""Compile-time materialization of a speculative scheme into the model.

The compiled engine is the only step executor ("Python builds, Rust
executes"): per-op pricing happens in Rust from an ``EngineSpec`` built by
walking the model's op lists once. A scheme therefore cannot inject draft
ops at query time the way the retired Python step path allowed — instead,
``materialize_spec_scheme`` folds the scheme into the model right after
``get_model`` attaches it, using two existing engine channels:

* **verify width** rides the engine's ``nextn`` decode-batch multiplier:
  ``model._nextn = verify_width - 1`` is set POST-construction, so model
  families built their op counts with ``nextn=0`` (no MTP layer scaling is
  baked in) while the Rust runtime scales the generation batch by
  ``(_nextn + 1)`` — exactly the verify forward width. The agg scheduler's
  ``decode_query_tokens`` and ``max_decode_progress`` read the same
  attribute and stay consistent for free.
* **draft-op token widths** ride the per-op ``scale_num_tokens`` divisor:
  a draft op drafting ``t`` tokens/request inside a ``verify_width``-wide
  phase carries ``scale_num_tokens = verify_width // t`` when the ratio is
  an integer (exact everywhere, including the small-m launch-floor region).
  Non-integer ratios (e.g. DSpark's 7-token draft under an 8-token verify)
  scale the RESULT by ``t / verify_width`` via ``scale_factor`` instead —
  exact for token-linear ops in the linear region, slightly optimistic in
  the small-m flat region.

**Dense decode attention** additionally carries the width channel end to
end: ``GenerationAttention`` (Python and Rust) folds the engine's width
multiplier out of its batch (``scale_num_tokens``, sequence basis — one KV
read per request) and prices a roofline guard from ``verify_query_tokens``
(lift to ideal-peak math of the full query block when compute, not the
shared KV read, would dominate — physics puts the crossover far above
practical widths, so the guard is a corner-case fence, not a calibration).
Exact wide-query pricing still requires collected data with a query_len
axis (delivery-package issue #7).

Transition-state limitations (tracked for follow-ups):

* MLA / DSA / linear-attention modules have no width channel yet: on those
  targets (e.g. DeepSeek-V4) verify attention keeps the conservative
  token-basis price.
* ``DraftOpSpec.query_overrides`` (e.g. a sliding-window KV cap) cannot
  ride the wire; affected draft attention prices at the phase sequence
  length.
* Per-round host-side scheduling glue (draft assembly, acceptance
  processing, KV bookkeeping) is NOT modeled: it is stack-version software
  cost outside the op tables, and small (~1.7 ms chain / ~3.6 ms tree per
  round on the H200 v2 serving ledger).
* Predictions are graph-basis (the op tables are collected in-graph).
  Deployments must extend the engine's CUDA-graph capture sizes to cover
  ``max_concurrency x verify_width`` tokens (vLLM's default 512-token
  ceiling is insufficient for speculation); the measured off-graph cliff
  is ~5x round time and is a deployment configuration issue, not a
  modeling target.

Draft op names are prefixed ``draft_`` to keep the breakdown keys identical
to the retired runtime-injection path (and to keep a standalone draft
model's op names from colliding with the target's).
