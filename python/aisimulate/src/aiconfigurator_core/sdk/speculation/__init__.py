"""Speculative-decoding schemes package.

Scheme modules register themselves via ``@register_spec_scheme("<kind>")``;
``pkgutil.iter_modules`` imports every sibling module at package import time
(the model-registry idiom), so **adding a scheme file is enough** — no edits
here.

Known accuracy envelope (zero-calibration contract, measured on
Qwen3-8B x H100 x vLLM against static-batch pure-decode rounds):

- The sequence-basis width channel has no fitted constants; deep-concurrency
  pure-decode rounds under-predict by ~10-18% (the shared-KV floor misses
  real wide-kernel inefficiencies). A bracket-blend calibration was
  evaluated and REJECTED: its two fitted parameters did not transfer out of
  the fitted domain (isl-1k deep-c +41-45% on long-context pure decode).
  Structural fixes (a physically-bounded token-basis component for the
  KV-read share) are follow-up work; do not reintroduce fitted patches.
