class NoResultsError(RuntimeError):
    """Base class for *expected* "the sweep produced no results" outcomes.

    These are not bugs: they mean a sweep ran to completion but every parallel
    configuration was ruled out for an understood reason (SLA infeasible, OOM,
    KV-cache capacity). They carry an actionable message and should be reported
    cleanly (no Python traceback), unlike a genuine crash.

    A per-op data miss (``PerfDataNotAvailableError``) is deliberately NOT in
    this family -- it can be skipped on one config while others still produce
    results -- and has its own recognizer ``has_perf_data_not_available_cause``.

    Subclasses ``RuntimeError`` so existing ``except RuntimeError`` / ``except
    Exception`` callers (e.g. the per-config sweep catch, support-matrix) keep
    catching them unchanged. Recognize the whole family via
    :func:`is_expected_no_result_cause`, which walks the exception chain so a
    generic wrapper raised ``from`` one of these is still classified correctly.

class PerfDataNotAvailableError(RuntimeError):
    """Raised when required performance data is missing or unsupported for a requested mode.

    This is a *per-op* data-miss raised deep inside a single config's evaluation
    (and in non-sweep paths like validate / single-point estimate), so it is
    deliberately NOT a :class:`NoResultsError`: a miss on one config can be
    skipped while other configs still produce results. Recognize it via
    ``has_perf_data_not_available_cause`` in ``perf_database``.

class EmpiricalNotImplementedError(RuntimeError):
    """Raised when the empirical (SOL/util) path has no basis to estimate an op.

    Distinct from ``PerfDataNotAvailableError`` (SILICON has no exact bracket but
    HYBRID may still estimate): this is the terminal signal that even the
    empirical fallback found nothing to calibrate from — no own-shape util, no
    cross-shape/sibling transfer reference. We raise instead of returning a
    placeholder ``SOL / constant`` so missing coverage surfaces honestly rather
    than as a fabricated number. Genuinely table-less ops (mem / p2p /
    element-wise) keep their own analytic formulas and never reach here.
