# Full Support Matrix Scan Plan

Goal: before shipping the Rust engine-step migration, exhaustively verify
that the Rust core matches Python across every `(model, system, backend,
version, mode)` tuple that the official support matrix currently
reports as `PASS`, with no regression in `PASS` status and engine-step
output drift within tolerance.

This scan is expected to run for hours-to-days. It MUST be
resumable.

## Scope

### Entries

- Source: the 10 per-system CSVs under
  `src/aiconfigurator/systems/support_matrix/{a100_sxm,b200_sxm,b300_sxm,
  b60,gb200,gb300,h100_sxm,h200_sxm,l40s,rtx_pro_6000_server}.csv`.
- Filter: `Status == PASS` rows only. Across all 10 systems that is
  **2,016 entries** (each row is one `(model, system, backend, version,
  mode)` tuple — `mode` is already split per row).
- Skip: `FAIL`, `HW_INCOMPATIBLE`, `FRAMEWORK_INCOMPATIBLE`. Those rows
  do not run today and cannot drift. The status-regression check below
  separately catches the case where a previously-`PASS` row becomes
  `FAIL` on the Rust path.

### What "matches" means per entry

Two layers, both required to pass:

1. **Engine-step probe** (fast, tight tolerance).
   For each entry, call `cli_estimate(engine_step_backend="python")`
   and `cli_estimate(engine_step_backend="rust")` on a fixed probe
   shape derived from the same test constraints the support-matrix
   generator already uses (`isl=256, osl=256, prefix=128`, parallelism
   from per-model size class). Compare `ttft` and `tpot`:
   - **rtol ≤ 1%, atol = 1e-3 ms.**
   - Symmetric error contract: both engines raising = pass; only one
     raising = fail.

2. **`cli_default` Pareto comparison** (slow, layered tolerance).
   For the same entry, run `cli_default(engine_step_backend="python")`
   and `cli_default(engine_step_backend="rust")`. Compare the
   resulting `pareto_df` via the existing `_compare_pareto_dfs`:
   - **Strict per-row Pareto metric: rtol ≤ 1%, atol = 1e-3.** This
     fires when Python and Rust pick the same frontier rows.
   - **Frontier envelope fallback: rtol ≤ 5%, atol = 1e-3.** This
     fires when row selection differs. Tightening it below 5% is not
     feasible — Pareto-row selection is discrete, so engine-step drift
     well below 1% can still shuffle which configuration each backend
     picks. The relaxed envelope check still bounds the user-visible
     end-to-end outcome.

The probe-layer <1% tolerance is the hard correctness signal; the
`cli_default` layer is the end-to-end UX signal.

### Status-regression check

Independent of drift: any entry that is `PASS` in the baseline CSV but
errors on Rust today is a regression. The runner records both:

- `python_status`: PASS / FAIL / ERROR (sanity check; must stay `PASS`
  for in-scope entries).
- `rust_status`: PASS / FAIL / ERROR.

A row with `python_status=PASS` and `rust_status!=PASS` is a regression
even if no drift comparison was possible.

## Storage / checkpointing

Single SQLite file: `rust/aiconfigurator-core/parity_tests/scan.sqlite`.

### Schema

```

### Resume semantics

- On startup, the runner reads `entries` (populating it from the
  baseline CSVs on first run).
- For each entry, it skips `probe_results` rows that already exist
  with a non-`PENDING` status, EXCEPT rows whose status is `TIMEOUT`
  — those are treated as "not yet successfully run" and re-attempted
  on the next invocation (with the new run's timeout budget). Same
  rule for `pareto_results`.
- A SIGINT or crash mid-entry leaves the entry without a result row —
  the next run re-attempts it. (Worker processes write their result
  row atomically at the end of the entry; partial state is not
  persisted.)
- Resumption is idempotent across code changes only if `commit_sha` in
  `run_meta` matches `HEAD`. If it differs, the runner aborts with a
  message explaining that the user must either explicitly `--continue`
  (acknowledging cross-commit results), `--reset`, or use a new
  SQLite path.

### Concurrency

- N worker processes (default: `os.cpu_count() // 2` to leave headroom
  for the Python+Rust per-process load).
- A single coordinator process owns the SQLite connection in
  `journal_mode=WAL`, `synchronous=NORMAL`. Workers send their
  per-entry result over a `multiprocessing.Queue`; the coordinator
  batches commits every ~1 s or every 50 rows.
- Per-entry timeout: 15 minutes wall-clock (probe + `cli_default`).
  Entries that time out are recorded as `status=TIMEOUT` and re-tried
  on a subsequent run.

## Runner

New CLI: `tools/support_matrix/scan_rust_parity.py`.

```bash
uv run python tools/support_matrix/scan_rust_parity.py \
    --baseline-dir src/aiconfigurator/systems/support_matrix \
    --db-path     rust/aiconfigurator-core/parity_tests/scan.sqlite \
    --workers     16 \
    --scan-mode   both \
    --probe-rtol  0.01 \
    --probe-atol  0.001 \
    --pareto-strict-rtol 0.01 \
    --pareto-envelope-rtol 0.05 \
    --per-entry-timeout-sec 900
```

`--scan-mode {probe_only,pareto_only,both}` so a fast probe-only scan
can run first (filters obvious regressions; ~17 min on a 16-worker
host per the wall-clock estimate below), and a `--scan-mode
pareto_only` follow-up can run unattended on entries the probe
accepted.

Status output: a periodic stderr line (every 30 s) of
`done / pending / errored / drifted` counts; full results in
SQLite.

## Wall-clock estimate

Assuming ~8 s per probe entry and ~60 s per `cli_default` entry, on
16 workers:

- Probe-only: 2,016 / 16 × 8 s ≈ **17 minutes**.
- `cli_default`-only: 2,016 / 16 × 60 s ≈ **2.1 hours**.
- Combined (`both`): ≈ **2.3 hours** if workers can interleave.

Add 20–40% headroom for `cli_default` outliers (large MoE sweeps,
disagg mode), tail timeouts, and SQLite write coalescing. Plan budget:
**4–8 hours wall-clock** on a 16-worker host. Days-long runs only
happen if `--workers 1` or a smaller host. The checkpoint design
covers both.

## Reporting

After the scan finishes (or at any point — the SQLite is queryable
live):

- `scan_rust_parity.py report --db-path scan.sqlite` prints:
  - Total entries / probed / pareto-checked / regressed / drifted.
  - Per-system summary (one row per system CSV).
  - Top-N drift entries (sorted by `tpot_drift_pct` desc).
  - Regression list (`python_status=PASS, rust_status!=PASS`).
- Also emits `scan_results.csv` mirroring the existing
  support-matrix CSV shape, plus drift columns, so the team can diff
  against the baseline `support_matrix/` CSVs row-for-row.

## Failure budgets

The scan is considered "ship-ready" when:

1. **Zero status regressions**: no row where `python_status=PASS,
   rust_status!=PASS`.
2. **Probe drift ≤ 1%** on every in-scope entry. Exceptions must be
   documented in this file with a root cause (data-grid edge,
   table-extrapolation, deliberate divergence, etc.).
3. **Pareto comparison** for every entry resolves as `STRICT_PASS` or
   `ENVELOPE_PASS`. `DRIFT` entries must each be triaged before ship.
4. **No `TIMEOUT` entries** persist after a final clean re-run.

Any `DRIFT` or `REGRESSION` rows must be triaged before merge, the
same way the existing parity smoke suite is triaged today.

## Implementation work-items

| # | Item | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| W1 | New runner module `tools/support_matrix/scan_rust_parity.py` | CLI, SQLite IO, worker pool, signal handling. |
| W2 | Probe driver: per-entry `cli_estimate` Python+Rust + drift compute | Reuses `cli_estimate` already exposed via `aiconfigurator.cli.api`. |
| W3 | Pareto driver: reuse existing `SupportMatrix.run_single_test` with `compare_engine_step_backends=True` | Adjust tolerances to <1% strict / 5% envelope. |
| W4 | SQLite schema + migrations | Single file; one-time creation. |
| W5 | Resume + commit-sha guard | Refuse to mix results across commits unless `--continue`. |
| W6 | Reporting subcommand | `report`, `report --csv`, `report --drift-only`. |
| W7 | CI hook (optional) | `--scan-mode probe_only --workers 8 --top-n 50` smoke for PRs. Full scan stays manual. |

W1–W6 are required pre-ship. W7 is a nice-to-have follow-up.

## Stop conditions

Stop and re-plan if:

- The probe scan returns a regression class (>50 rows with the same
  failure mode). Likely a structural bug in the Rust crate — fix
  before continuing the scan.
- `cli_default` runtime per entry exceeds 5× the estimate above on
  the host of choice; revisit the parallelism strategy or shard by
  system.
- SQLite contention causes the runner to spend >10% of wall-clock on
  writes. Switch to per-system shard files and a post-run merge.
- Resume after a code change shows results that contradict the
  pre-change run on identical entries — surface the suspect rows and
  triage before continuing.

## Scan outcome — 2026-06-01

First full-matrix Pareto scan completed on `codex/rust-phase-3` after applying the C1–C4-residual fix campaign. Run on macOS arm64 (Mac15,7), 2 workers, resumed across multiple sessions via `--continue-across-commits`.

Working DB at `scan.sqlite` (repo root, gitignored) preserves the per-entry verdicts. Re-derive these tables by querying `pareto_results`:

```sql
SELECT comparison_outcome, COUNT(*)
FROM pareto_results
GROUP BY comparison_outcome;
```

### Outcome counts

| Outcome | Count | Note |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `STRICT_PASS` | 1906 | Rust frontier within strict per-row tolerance |
| `DRIFT` | 16 | Pareto throughput diverges >5% on at least one frontier point |
| `ERROR` | 94 | Configs that fail to evaluate in one or both engines (symmetric or one-sided) |
| `REGRESSION` | 0 | All regressions eliminated by C2 |

Pass rate on entries that complete on both sides: **1906 / 1922 = 99.17%**.

### Trajectory of the fix campaign

| Stage | DRIFT | REGRESSION | Cluster addressed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Initial scan | 559 | 157 | baseline |
| **C1** | 358 | 157 | MoE dispatch backend differentiation (`operators/moe_dispatch.rs`) — vllm vs sglang-non-deepep vs trtllm |
| **C2** | 100 | **0** | 2D-1D interpolation intersect-then-bracket on cross-row sparsity (`interpolation.rs`) — also cleared all 157 regressions |
| **C4** | ~50 | 0 | MTP `_mtp_scale_factor` plumbed into DeepSeek-family + Qwen3.5 generation ops (`models/base.rs`, `deepseek*.rs`, `qwen35.rs`) |
| **C4-residual** | **16** | 0 | `(nextn+1)` batch multiplier in agg-path Rust bridges (`sdk/rust_engine_step.py`) |

97% drift reduction. Full elimination of regressions.

(Numeric `strict_max_drift_pct` and `frontier_envelope_pct` columns are NULL in the current `scan.sqlite` because the runner stored the verdict but did not back-populate the per-row drift sizes; the runner work-item to record these is open.)

### Root-cause clusters (R1–R5 parallel diagnose pass)

| Cluster | Approx. entries | Root cause | Fix |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| **R2 + R3 + R4** — NCCL/OneCCL path | ~10 | `CommunicationTable` rebuilds NCCL/OneCCL perf-DB paths without consulting `SystemSpec.misc.{nccl_version,oneccl_version}` — wrong revision picked for certain `(system, backend-version)` combos. The DeepSeek-R1/V3/Kimi on gb200/gb300/b300 and the Nemotron-H disagg entries point at this single bug. | ~20 LoC in `perf_database/communication.rs:150-162` + `perf_database/mod.rs:102`: pass `SystemSpec` into `CommunicationTable` and rebuild paths as `<systems_root>/<data_dir>/{nccl,oneccl}/<spec.misc.{nccl_version,oneccl_version}>/...`. Expected to clear all ~10 entries in one fix. |
| **R1** — Scan-comparator artifact | ~5 | Per-op parity well within 0.2%; the scan comparator picks the degenerate `bs=1` endpoint where Python's noise dominates. Not a real engine bug. The small-model Qwen3 entries (1.7B/8B/Qwen3.5-27B) and possibly one of the Qwen3-30B-A3B variants belong here. | Optional: tighten the per-row strict tolerance in `tools/support_matrix/support_matrix.py:62-66`, or filter out endpoints with insufficient sample density. |
| **R5** — Frontier-pick disagreement | 1–2 | Rust and Python agree on per-config throughput but pick a different point as the frontier knee. `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-405B` is the confirmed case; `Meta-Llama-3.1-8B` agg may share this cause. | Investigation pending. Likely a tie-breaking comparison in the Pareto dominance test that flips on near-equal floats. |

Specific cluster assignments per entry are not encoded in `scan.sqlite`; the R-cluster diagnose agents derived them from per-op breakdown comparisons. Re-running the R-cluster pass on individual entries reproduces the same finding.

### Recommended next steps before ship

1. **Apply the NCCL/OneCCL path fix** (R2+R3+R4). Single ~20-LoC change; expected to clear ~10 of the 16 DRIFT entries.
2. **Tighten or annotate the scan comparator** for R1's bs=1-endpoint false positives, or accept them as known-good-with-rationale.
3. **Triage R5** by comparing the full sorted frontier (not just the strict-row comparator output) for the meta-llama entries.
4. **Back-populate** `strict_max_drift_pct` / `frontier_envelope_pct` in the scan runner for future scans.
